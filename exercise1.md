The language our team of 6 developers are using is C#.
For linting, we're going to add an EditorConfig file to the project or codebase to enforce consistent coding styles for everyone that works in the codebase. EditorConfig settings take precedence over global Visual Studio text editor settings. This means that you can tailor each codebase to use text editor settings that are specific to that project.
For testing, a MS Test project will be created to run unit tests to maintain code health, ensure code coverage, and find errors and faults before your customers do. 
Visual Studio will be used to build the C# application.
AzureDevOps will be used for CI/CD. One of the key features of Azure DevOps is Azure Pipelines, which is a cloud-based service that automates the creation and delivery of software. Azure Pipelines enables you to build and deploy faster with pipelines that support every major platform and tool. You can also use Azure Pipelines to create data pipelines that ingest, process, and share data for data science and machine learning applications.

Due to the nature of the project, we will use a cloud based environment for the following reasons:
Budget:  Cloud-based CI/CD can be more flexible and cost-effective, as you only pay for what you use, and you can scale up or down as needed. However, it can also be more expensive in the long run, as you have to pay for the service fees and the cloud resources2
Security: Cloud-based CI/CD can be less secure in some respects, as you have to trust the service provider with your data and infrastructure, and you have to comply with their security policies and standards. However, it also benefits from the service provider’s expertise, resources, and security measures.
Scalability:  Cloud-based CI/CD can be more scalable, as you can leverage the service provider’s hardware and software capacity, and you can adjust to your current needs. However, it also introduces more variability and uncertainty, as you have to deal with performance and availability fluctuations
Performance:  Cloud-based CI/CD can be slower, as you have higher latency and lower bandwidth, and you have to rely on the service provider’s network and system configuration. However, it also requires less resources and optimization, as you can offload the load and traffic of your CI/CD operations to the service provider
Control: Cloud-based CI/CD can give you less control, as you have limited access and ownership of your data and infrastructure, and you have to adapt and conform to the service provider’s CI/CD tools and workflows. However, it also offers more convenience and support, as you have to worry less about your data and infrastructure, and you have access to the service provider’s features and assistance
